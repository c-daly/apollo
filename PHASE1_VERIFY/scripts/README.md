# PHASE1_VERIFY Scripts

This directory contains verification scripts for Phase 1 of the Apollo implementation, focusing on E2E testing of the Apollo CLI integration with Sophia and HCG.

## Overview

These scripts verify that the Apollo CLI properly routes commands through the system instead of relying on direct database operations (Cypher queries). This ensures proper separation of concerns and validates the complete integration stack.

## Scripts

### M4 Test: End-to-End Goal Creation Flow

**Script**: `m4_test.py`

**Purpose**: Verifies the complete flow of creating a goal through Apollo CLI and optionally verifying its presence in Neo4j.

**What it tests**:
1. Apollo CLI can connect to Sophia service
2. Goals can be created via `apollo-cli goal` command
3. State can be fetched via `apollo-cli state` command
4. Goals are properly stored in Neo4j (optional verification)

**Prerequisites**:
- Apollo CLI installed: `pip install -e .`
- Sophia service running on `localhost:8080`
- (Optional) Neo4j running on `bolt://localhost:7687` for verification

**Usage**:

```bash
# Run the M4 test
./PHASE1_VERIFY/scripts/m4_test.py

# Or with Python
python PHASE1_VERIFY/scripts/m4_test.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
============================================================
        M4 E2E Test: Apollo CLI Goal Creation
============================================================

============================================================

Running: apollo-cli goal Navigate to the kitchen and pick up the red block --priority high
✓ Goal created: Navigate to the kitchen and pick up the red block

============================================================
        Step 3: Fetch State via Apollo CLI
============================================================

Running: apollo-cli state
✓ State fetched successfully

============================================================
         Step 4: Verify Goal in Neo4j
============================================================

✓ Goal found in Neo4j: Navigate to the kitchen and pick up the red block

============================================================
                M4 Test Result
============================================================

✓ All test steps completed successfully!

✓ M4 E2E TEST PASSED
```

## Apollo CLI Commands

### Create a Goal

Create a new goal in the Sophia cognitive core:

```bash
apollo-cli goal "Navigate to the kitchen"
```

**With priority**:
```bash
apollo-cli goal "Pick up the red block" --priority high
```

**Options**:
- `--priority`: Set goal priority (`high`, `normal`, `low`). Default: `normal`

**Example output**:
```yaml
goal_id: "goal_123"
description: "Navigate to the kitchen"
status: "pending"
priority: "high"
created_at: "2025-11-19T14:00:00Z"
```

### Fetch Current State

Retrieve the current agent state from Sophia:

```bash
apollo-cli state
```

**Example output**:
```yaml
status: "active"
current_goal: "Navigate to the kitchen"
position:
  x: 10
  y: 5
  z: 0
timestamp: "2025-11-19T14:00:00Z"
```

### Send a Command

Send a natural language command to Sophia:

```bash
apollo-cli send "move forward 2 meters"
```

### Check Status

Display connection status and configuration:

```bash
apollo-cli status
```

### View Plans

Show recent plans generated by Sophia:

```bash
apollo-cli plans --recent 10
```

## API Endpoints

The Apollo CLI communicates with Sophia through these HTTP REST API endpoints:

### Create Goal
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/goals`
- **Payload**: 
  ```json
  {
    "goal": "Navigate to the kitchen",
    "metadata": {
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Goal object with ID and status

### Get State
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/state`
- **Response**: Current agent state object

### Send Command
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/command`
- **Payload**: 
  ```json
  {
    "command": "move forward"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Command execution result

### Get Plans
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/plans?limit=10`
- **Response**: List of recent plans

## Configuration

Apollo uses a configuration file to connect to services. Create a `config.yaml` in your working directory or use the default configuration:

```yaml
sophia:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  timeout: 30

hcg:
  neo4j:
    uri: bolt://localhost:7687
    user: neo4j
    password: password
  milvus:
    host: localhost
    port: 19530
```

You can also specify a custom config file:

```bash
apollo-cli --config path/to/config.yaml goal "Your goal"
```

## Running the Test Suite

To run all Apollo tests including the M4 E2E test:

```bash
# Run Python unit tests
pytest

# Run M4 E2E test
./PHASE1_VERIFY/scripts/m4_test.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

If you see "Cannot connect to Sophia" errors:

1. Verify Sophia service is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

2. Check your configuration:
   ```bash
   apollo-cli status
   ```

3. Ensure Docker containers are running (if using Docker):
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

### Goal Not Found in Neo4j

If the M4 test reports that a goal wasn't found in Neo4j:

1. This is expected if there's a delay in synchronization
2. The test will still pass with an informational message
3. You can manually verify by querying Neo4j:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (g:Goal) RETURN g
   ```

### Import Errors

If you see "neo4j driver not installed" warnings:

```bash
pip install neo4j
```

This is only needed for the Neo4j verification step and is optional.

## Architecture

The verification flow demonstrates the proper architecture:

```
M4 Test → Apollo CLI → HTTP API → Sophia Service → HCG (Neo4j)
```

This replaces the anti-pattern of:

```
Test → Direct Cypher → Neo4j (❌ bypasses Sophia)
```
